# Scripting NGINX with njs for Fun and (No) Profit: Code Examples
This repository contains code examples from a talk given at NGINX Sprint 2.0.

## Differences from the talk
The code examples are more heavily annotated than those presented in the talk.
They may also differ slightly as the code examples in the talk were optimised for
quick presentation.  The code examples in this repository should be considered a better example.
